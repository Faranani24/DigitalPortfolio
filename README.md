In this module, Professional Practice 3, I focused on building my professional identity and understanding workplace readiness. One of the main deliverables was a Career Development portfolio, which included several activities aimed at improving soft and hard skills. I completed tasks such as a personality assessment, workplace etiquette, interview skills training, CV creation, and professional networking strategies. I scored 100% in multiple formative assessments, including Career Development and Personality Assessment, showing strong engagement and understanding of the content.
Additionally, I worked on mock interviews and a GitHub digital portfolio, which helped me compile and present my technical and soft skills effectively. This course prepared me for the job market by emphasizing personal branding, business communication, and the job-seeking process.
Although a few tasks were submitted late due to workload and overlap with other modules, I ensured the quality of my submissions remained high. Overall, this module helped bridge the gap between academic knowledge and the expectations of the professional world.
